BRICKED is a brick breaking game where the goal is to clear all the 
bricks from the screen through hitting them with the ball. In BRICKED,
you control a paddle to bounce the ball back towards the bricks. If you miss,
you'll lose a life. Lose all your lives and it's game over.

There are on screen directions to progress through the screens. If unsure,
press 'a' or 'start' to progress. Press the 'a' button or the 'start' button
to get the ball moving. Then, the left and right arrows are used to control the
paddle. Break your way through all 5 levels and you'll be the victor!

At any point, you can press the 'select' button to return to the title screen.

(If you find yourself struggling to hit that last brick, try using the up arrow
to give yourself a little help.)
